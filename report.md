## Statement of compliance

A statement of compliance listing all the implemented and un-implemented features. (i.e. a check-list of achieved functionalities)

### Subscriptions, Requests, and Locations

You need to design Java classes to represent subscriptions, requests, and locations of users. Java objects created from these classes will be mapped into DynamoDB data items and stored.

### Web Services

You need to design web services to support the required operations of the web app. Here are some operations potentially needed:
- To send/approve/deny a subscription request
- To check-in a user’s current location
- To retrieve a list of subscriptions
- To retrieve a specification user’s location
- To retrieve all friends’ locations

### The User Interface

The user interface must be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the help of the jQuery, jQueryUI libraries and the GoogleMap JavaScript API.

## Implementation

A description of your Java classes modelling the subscriptions, requests, and user locations.

### `User` class

## API specification

An API specification of your web services. For each web service, you should describe:
  - The operation performed by the web service.
  - The HTTP method used.
  - The URL pattern.
  - The parameters passed with the request.
  - All possible status codes returned by the web service, and their corresponding meanings.
  - The result returned on a successful request. Describe how the result is represented.
